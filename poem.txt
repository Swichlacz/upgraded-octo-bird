    A LIttle Bird I Am
 
    "A little bird I am,
    Shut from the fields of air,
    And in my cage I sit and sing
    To Him who placed me there:
    Well pleased a prisoner to be,
    Because, my God, it pleases Thee!


    "Naught have I else to do;
    I sing the whole day long;
    And He whom most I love to please
    Doth listen to my song,
    He caught and bound my wandering wing,
    But still He bends to hear me sing."
    
    -Louisa May Alcott
