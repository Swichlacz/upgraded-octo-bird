#A Little Bird I Am

:bird:

By *Louisa May Alcott*

"A little bird I am,<br>
Shut from the fields of air,<br>
And in my cage I sit and sing<br>
To Him who placed me there:<br>
Well pleased a prisoner to __be__,<br>
Because, my God, it pleases __Thee__!<br>


"Naught have I else to do;<br>
I sing the whole day long;<br>
And He whom most I love to please<br>
Doth listen to my song,<br>
He caught and bound my wandering __wing__,<br>
But still He bends to hear me __sing__."<br>
